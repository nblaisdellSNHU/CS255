## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved us taking on the role of a system analyst to help design a system for the company "DriverPass". DriverPass is looking to create a system which will help people get driving lessons so they can be more prepared for the driving lesson at the DMV, ultimately so that the rate of passing students at the DMV goes up. They were looking to build a web-based platform for customers to be able to make reservations for driving lessons through their company, and that system should have been available on all devices.

## What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did particularly well on the Business Requirements Document. I had a good understanding from the interview transcript, plus using my own experience of being in those types of meetings, to gather the appropriate notes to capture all of the things that DriverPass was looking to have in their newly built system.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would definitely choose to revise the System Design Document, since I was unable to get all of the diagrams done in time. I would make sure I set aside more time for the project, and focus more on the use cases so that I can build those use cases into further diagrams.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By taking the information directly from the interview transcript, and making sure that all of the things that were requested by the DriverPass team was actually addressed as part of our design. It's vitally important to make sure that the user's needs are met during the design, otherwise there is really no point in building whatever you're designing, if nobody is going to use it.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Before, I had a very "jump right in" approach to designing software, which was not very good for trying to build complex things, because as the project goes on, progress tends to slow since there's no clear vision of what should be done next. By utilizing techniques like we learned in CS255, I can think about the design on any particular project beforehand, using the standardized diagrams that we learned how to create, and then start coding. I think that will yeild much better results.
